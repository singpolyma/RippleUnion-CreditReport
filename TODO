thread A that just waits on websocket for messages
	If it's not a sort we understand, ignore it

thread B that gets signaled by thread A on new message and also takes requests to be sent out
	If it's a transaction, are we waiting for this one to auth someone?
		If yes, then switch their status
	If it's a response we're waiting for, send it back
	Else, ignore it


Assertion should get a real datatype so it can have instances of FromRow and ToRow.  It should carry around the blob.  We store normalized data from the blob in the DB for aggregation and sorting, but might as well use it for display.  Split out parser for assertion words so we can use it in this context?

Need JSON outputs also, just derive ToJSON for the record I expect.  Include blobs in the JSON?

NO SEQUENTIAL IDS!  What to make permalinks for blobs?  address/timestamp?  We probably want to reject dupes there anyway?  Start with that, I think.
