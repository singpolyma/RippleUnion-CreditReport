thread A that just waits on websocket for messages
	If it's not a sort we understand, ignore it

thread B that gets signaled by thread A on new message and also takes requests to be sent out
	If it's a transaction, are we waiting for this one to auth someone?
		If yes, then switch their status
	If it's a response we're waiting for, send it back
	Else, ignore it
