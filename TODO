user sigining a UserID is not strong enough.  Encrypt them a random number < 1 and have them ripple that amount of XRP, then whatever address ripples us that amount is their address.  This cannot be verified by others, but others can verify the key whatever way they want, all this does is let us assert on the website that the key is beloning to a certain address.
